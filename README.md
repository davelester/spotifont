## Examples of Search API
The Search API is accessible by visiting ```localhost:5000/search/tagname```, where ```tagname``` is the uncontrolled term that's being searched for.

The response looks like this: ```[ {"fontname": "Arial", "controlled": "Sans-Serif" }, {"fontname": "Garamond", "controlled": "Serif" } ]```
